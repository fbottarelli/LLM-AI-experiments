# Obsidian Note Organizer with Tags and GPT

## Project Overview

This project is designed to help organize and classify notes in an Obsidian Vault using predefined tags. The goal is to systematically categorize the notes based on topics and make them easier to manage and retrieve. The project leverages OpenAI's GPT to assist in classifying the content of each note into one of the predefined categories. Once classified, the notes are tagged and moved to appropriate folders for better organization.

## How It Works

1. **Tagging System**: The project uses a predefined set of topics (tags) to classify notes. These tags represent different categories or areas of interest, such as "knowledge," "life space," "work and study," etc.
  
2. **Note Processing**: The script reads each note, extracts a portion of its content, and uses GPT to determine which tag best fits that content based on the predefined topics.

3. **Automated Organization**: After classification, the note is tagged and moved to a corresponding folder based on the assigned tag. This ensures that notes are organized by topic and can be more easily navigated within Obsidian.

## Key Features

- **Content Classification with GPT**: The script uses OpenAI's GPT API to classify the content of notes based on the given tags.
- **Automatic Tagging**: Once a note is classified, the script adds the appropriate tag directly to the note.
- **Folder Organization**: Notes are automatically moved to folders corresponding to their assigned tags, keeping the vault neatly organized.

## How to Use

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Install dependencies with:
  ```bash
  pip install openai python-dotenv
  ```

- Set up your OpenAI API key in a `.env` file:
  ```
  OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
  ```

### Running the Script

1. **Set Your Base Directory**: Update the `base_directory` variable in the `if __name__ == "__main__"` block with the path to your Obsidian Vault.

2. **Define Your Categories**: Edit the `predefined_topics` list to include the categories you want to use for classification.

3. **Run the Script**:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

4. The script will process each note, classify it using GPT, tag it, and move it to the appropriate folder. A log file (`organizzazione_note.log`) will be created to track the processing steps.

### Script Flow

1. **Reading the Note**: The script reads the first part of each note to extract a relevant excerpt (default length: 200 characters).

2. **Classifying with GPT**: The extracted content is fed into GPT to classify it based on the predefined topics.

3. **Tagging the Note**: The appropriate tag is added to the note.

4. **Organizing into Folders**: The note is moved to a folder named after the assigned tag. (TO DO)


## Future Improvements

- the moving to correct folder part
- Support for more complex tagging systems, including multiple tags per note.
- Enhancing the classification algorithm to account for more detailed context.
- Building a GUI for easier use and interaction.
