timestamp: Unix timestamp of observations
EDA_raw: Electrodermal Activity measurement
medicationIntake: Indicator of medication intake (1: taken, 0: not taken)
wearingOff: Indicator of wearing off effect (1: present, 0: absent)
last_med_intake: Index of last medication intake event
med_time_diff: Time since last medication intake
last_wo: Index of last wearing off event
wo_time_diff: Time since last wearing off event
Initial data exploration completed
Basic summary statistics generated for all variables
Data transformations applied: medicationIntake and wearingOff converted to numeric
Derived variables added: last_med_intake, med_time_diff, last_wo, wo_time_diff
Analyze temporal patterns in EDA measurements
Investigate relationship between medication intake and EDA
Explore frequency and timing of wearing off events
