## Features
- Automatically retrieves and processes blood test images.
- Uses AI to extract relevant data from the images.
- Saves extracted data in CSV format.
- Supports batch processing of multiple images.
- Future integration with SQLite for data storage and dashboard visualization.

## Future Work
- Integrate SQLite to store extracted data for historical analysis.
- Develop a dashboard to visualize blood test values over time.
